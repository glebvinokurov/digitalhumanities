## Short Biography

I am a PhD candidate in German Studies at McGill's Languages, Literatures, and Cultures department. Currently, I teach German and work  at the Osler Library of the History of Medicine. I studied Slavic, German, and English Philology, Library and Information Science, and Book History and Print Culture in Freiburg, Berlin, and Toronto. My research interests include Russian, Czech, and German Modernism, samizdat, and contemporary music, art, and literature. Recent publications include articles on the German-based Russian writer/artist Rea Nikonova, Russian and East European materials at the Sackner Archive of Concrete and Visual Poetry, Glenn Goluska's Imprimerie Dromadaire, and contributions to the exhibition catalogue *Maximum Imaginativeness: An Exhibition on Modern Czech Book Design (1900–1950) from the Collections of the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library, University of Toronto.* 

## My Research Project

For my dissertation I am planning to investigate connections and influences between contemporary German literature and East European literatures, for example in the works of Romanian-born German poet (and member of Oulipo) Oskar Pastior, Romanian-born Nobel laureate Herta Müller, Swiss Slavist/poet/novelist Felix-Philipp Ingold, or Ingeborg Bachmann Prize winner Olga Martynova who writes prose in German and poetry in Russian.

Currently, I am also working on an article on the Chuvash poet Gennadiy Aygi and intermediality.
